## Substance look and feel - getting started

This document describes the steps to create a sample Swing application and run it under Substance look and feel.

**Substance** requires JDK 9 or later to run. If you don't have such an installation on your machine, you need to download it from [this site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and install it. All terminal-based examples below assume that **java** executable is in the path. This executable is part of JRE (under **bin** folder) as well as part of JDK (under **bin** folder). Consult your OS manual on how to add the relevant folder to the path. Alternatively, you can put the entire path to the **java** executable in the scripts below.

After you have JDK 9 installed on your machine, create the following `Walkthrough.java` file:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.image.*;

public class Walkthrough extends JFrame {
  public Walkthrough() {
    super("Sample app");
    this.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
    this.add(new JButton("button"));
    this.add(new JCheckBox("check"));
    this.add(new JLabel("label"));

    this.setIconImage(new BufferedImage(1, 1, BufferedImage.TYPE_4BYTE_ABGR));
    this.setSize(new Dimension(250, 80));
    this.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
    this.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    JFrame.setDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated(true);

    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
        Walkthrough w = new Walkthrough();
        w.setVisible(true);
    });
  }
}
```

This is a simple frame (that does nothing) with a button, a checkbox and a label. You can create this file in your favourite IDE or in any text editor. Once this file is created, compile it. If you're using an IDE, consult the IDE help on the compilation process. If you're using a simple text editor, you can compile this file by using:

`javac Walkthrough.java`

If you have problems, consult the online help for **javac** compiler. The compiled `Walkthrough.class` will be created in the same folder as your `Walkthrough.java`. In order to run it, use:

`java -cp . Walkthrough`

You will see the following frame under the default Ocean look and feel:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirill-grouchnikov/radiance/master/docs/images/substance/walkthrough/default-ocean.png" width="284" height="114">

In order to run the same frame under **Substance** look and feel, you first need to choose the Substance skin that you would like to use (see the links at the end of this document). Suppose that you choose the Business skin. Now you have the following options:

* Start your VM with `-Dswing.defaultlaf=org.pushingpixels.substance.api.skin.SubstanceBusinessLookAndFeel`
* `UIManager.setLookAndFeel(new SubstanceBusinessLookAndFeel())`
* `UIManager.setLookAndFeel("org.pushingpixels.substance.api.skin.SubstanceBusinessLookAndFeel");`
* `SubstanceCortex.GlobalScope.setSkin(new BusinessSkin());`

The first option doesn't require any code changes in the application above. Run the following script:

`java -Dswing.defaultlaf=org.pushingpixels.substance.api.skin.SubstanceBusinessLookAndFeel -cp . Walkthrough`

You will see the following exception:

This means that the **org.pushingpixels.substance.api.skin.SubstanceBusinessLookAndFeel** class in not found in the classpath. How do you get that dependency into your project?

The recommended way to add Substance to your project is to declare dependency on its Maven artifact:

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.pushing-pixels/radiance-substance/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.pushing-pixels/radiance-substance) `radiance-substance`

Alternatively, for a more manual process:
* Download a local copy of the latest Radiance.
* [Build](../building.md) Radiance locally with *gradlew* command.
* Copy the binaries with *gradlew copyJars* command. For version *X.Y.ZZ* of Radiance, add *radiance-substance-X.Y.ZZ.jar*, *radiance-trident-X.Y.ZZ.jar* and *radiance-neon-X.Y.ZZ.jar* to the place that has your local dependencies.

For earlier versions of Substance, see [this page](../archive/older-releases.md) for the list of binaries to take for the specific pre-Radiance versions.

Assuming that you have saved *radiance-substance.jar*, *radiance-trident.jar* and *radiance-neon.jar* to the *C:/temp* folder, use the following script in order to run the frame under Substance:

`java -Dswing.defaultlaf=org.pushingpixels.substance.api.skin.SubstanceBusinessLookAndFeel -cp .;C:/temp/radiance-substance.jar;C:/temp/radiance-trident.jar;C:/temp/radiance-neon.jar Walkthrough`

The result is the same frame under Substance Business look and feel:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirill-grouchnikov/radiance/master/docs/images/substance/walkthrough/business-substance.png" width="284" height="114">

The other two options for setting Substance require changing the code. Go back to your Java editor and replace the `main()` method by:

```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    JFrame.setDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated(true);
    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
        try {
          UIManager.setLookAndFeel(new SubstanceGraphiteLookAndFeel());
        } catch (Exception e) {
          System.out.println("Substance Graphite failed to initialize");
        }
        Walkthrough w = new Walkthrough();
        w.setVisible(true);
    });
  }
```
Note that here we are using another Substance skin, Graphite. In order to compile the new `Walkthrough.java`, you need to add the **radiance-substance.jar**, **radiance-trident.jar** and **radiance-neon.jar** to the build path. Consult your IDE help if you're using IDE. For command-prompt compilation, use the additional `-cp` flag:

`javac -cp C:/temp/radiance-substance.jar;C:/temp/radiance-trident.jar;C:/temp/radiance-neon.jar Walkthrough.java`

Now you can run your application without the `-Dswing.defaultlaf` JVM flag, but you still need to specify the location of **radiance-substance.jar**, **radiance-trident.jar** and **radiance-neon.jar** as before:

`java -cp .;C:/temp/radiance-substance.jar;C:/temp/radiance-trident.jar;C:/temp/radiance-neon.jar Walkthrough`

If you don't want to create an explicit dependency on the Substance classes in your code, change your `main()` method to:

```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    JFrame.setDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated(true);
    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
        try {
          UIManager.setLookAndFeel("org.pushingpixels.substance.api.skin.SubstanceGraphiteLookAndFeel");
        } catch (Exception e) {
          System.out.println("Substance Graphite failed to initialize");
        }
        Walkthrough w = new Walkthrough();
        w.setVisible(true);
    });
  }
```  
You can run the application the same way as before. Here is how it looks like:
