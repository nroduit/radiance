## Cookbook - exploring rich visuals with Substance

The [Cookbook demo app](https://github.com/kirill-grouchnikov/radiance/tree/master/demos/spyglass/src/main/java/org/pushingpixels/demo/spyglass/cookbook) takes the design of [Cookbook UI](http://flickr.com/photos/mydreamapp/sets/72157600046909364/) from the [My Dream App context](https://web.archive.org/web/20080117124702/http://mydreamapp.com:80/news/post/389/) and turns it into a Swing application powered by a custom Substance skin.

* [Step 1](01-analyze.md) is to analyze the original design
* [Step 2](02-map.md) is to map the design to Swing and Substance
* [Step 3](03-decorations.md) is to implement the decoration painting
* [Step 4](04-skin.md) is to implement the full skin
* [Step 5](05-polish.md) is to polish the visuals

The customization layer of Substance (especially the [painters](../../substance/painters/overview.md)) aims to create a customizable and powerful separation between painting layer and the rest of the application code (business logic such as persistence, authentication, communication and more). In this separation, Substance allows working on the application visuals as a separate work flow (although the process of mapping the application areas to Swing and Substance may require closer cooperation with implementing the actual UI container structure).

The ideal end result of this process is a self-contained implementation of the application skin that can be:

* tweaked as the design changes
* reused in other applications under the same portfolio
* even swapped out for a completely different appearance (such as using a native look-and-feel)

It took me about 20 hours to create the final visuals, and additional couple of hours when Radiance gained full hi-dpi support.

As the developer of Substance I have the advantage of knowing how the library is built and what APIs are available. The main goal for the Cookbook demo is to help Swing developers to understand the customization layer of Substance and use it to its fullest potential.

An important question that needs to be addressed is: why do you need to do it with Substance? Why would you want to tie yourself to a third-party library when you can override `paintComponent` and use `Java2D` to create all the visuals? While you can most certainly do so (and in fact, the light bar holder is implemented this way), Substance gives you quite a few advantages:

* Cleaner separation of the painting logic from your main application. A close cooperation with your design team that is made aware of the current Substance limitations may result in zero to very little custom painting code in your components even for such a complicated design as Cookbook UI.
* Performance of Substance is on par with the core look-and-feels. If your painting code is making heavy use of Java2D and images, you will need to provide a sophisticated caching layer to make sure that the UI remains responsive.
* The same Substance skin can be reused across multiple portfolio applications. Embedding custom painting code in your UI components may result in a code that is harder to refactor into reusable building blocks.
* Substance provides [animation effects](../../substance/animations.md) (rollover, selection, others) out of the box. These effects add a modern touch expected from visually rich applications.
* Substance provides a well-defined [plugin mechanism](../../substance/plugin.md) to support third-party components.
* Substance makes your applications safer by [checking EDT violations](https://www.pushing-pixels.org/2008/07/15/stricter-checks-on-edt-violations-in-substance.html) during the UI construction.
